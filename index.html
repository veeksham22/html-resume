    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/veeksham22/GDSC-solution-challenge-24.">Animal Intrusion detection</a>
        <p>Focusing on the integration of IoT and machine learning methods, the model uses ESP32 camera to analyze video 
            clips and create an animal incursion detection system. This approach can help prevent accidents, trace animals, and 
            theft, using efficient deep learning techniques. </p></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/veeksham22/Object-detection-using-ESP32-CAM.">Object-detection</a>
        <p>This project aims to implement object detection using the ESP32-CAM microcontroller and the Edge Impulse platform. 
            By integrating the ESP32-CAM with the Arduino IDE and training a model on Edge Impulse, we can create a cost
            effective solution for real-life object detection scenarios. </p></li>
